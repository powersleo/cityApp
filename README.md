# Executive Summary

As freshly legal drinking age participants, we have found that there are many different factors that come into play when choosing the right bar for tonight's party. Living in a big city, there are also lots of options. Of course, not every option is for everyone. Some places can be uniquely tailored to certain crowds and even be unwelcoming to others. Maybe the bar chosen for the night is known for having a rowdy crowd or a security compromise. The reality of the world is that unsafe environments exist, especially in large cities. One of the main problems in San Francisco is the introduction of fentanyl ridden drugs and common overdoses. Though it is not openly talked about, getting roofied in the club happens. Because of experiences that can be harmful rather than fun, we wanted to make sure that we can contribute to the safety of the nightlife scene by creating the cityCertifiedApp. Our app is a way for the local community to participate in spreading the word of their experiences at each bar/club. The app contains a map of San Francisco’s drinking destinations, where the users are able to write a review based on their observations. What makes us unique is the Safety Review option that contains ratings of these places’s security, crowd, ambiance and overall safety. Our goal is to make young people feel excited to go out knowing that they have chosen a spot that is right for their safety needs. It’s fun to be young, but it’s even more fun to know you’ll be able to get home in one piece.
